# Take-Home Assignment: Automated Testing Project for React Native Todo List Application

## Objective:
Develop and implement a suite of automated tests for a React Native-based todo list application. This assignment will assess your ability to work with React Native, write effective tests, and document your testing process.

### Assignment Details:

**1. Application Setup:**
- Start by creating a simple todo list application using React Native. You can follow a tutorial or use your own implementation. Ensure that your application includes features like adding, removing, and updating todos.
- Make sure you have Node.js, React Native CLI, and any necessary dependencies installed on your development machine.

**2. Tasks:**
- **Develop the Application:** Build the todo list application with React Native, focusing on clean and functional code. Pay attention to component structure and state management.
- **Write Unit Tests:** Create unit tests using a testing framework like Jest. Test individual components and functions to ensure they work as expected.
- **Write Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests that check the interaction between components and their behavior when todos are added, updated, or removed.
- **Write End-to-End Tests:** Utilize a tool like Detox or Appium to implement end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions with the application.

**3. Documentation:**
- **Bug Report:** Document any bugs or issues you encounter during development or testing in a structured bug report.
- **Testing Documentation:** Provide a README file that includes:
  - Instructions on how to set up and run your tests on both iOS and Android platforms.
  - A summary of your testing strategy, including the tools and frameworks used.
  - Descriptions of any significant bugs or issues found, along with their potential impact.

**4. Submission:**
- Push your completed project, including all test files and documentation, to a GitHub repository.
- Email the repository link to the hiring manager for review.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Completeness:** How well does the application fulfill the todo list functionalities?
- **Quality of Testing:** Are the tests thorough and cover various scenarios, including edge cases?
- **Documentation:** Clarity and detail in the bug reports and test documentation.
- **Problem Solving:** Effectiveness in identifying and documenting issues.
